## 🏛️ From Think Philosophy (Simon Blackburn)

### Critical Thinking Actions
1. **Philosophical Action 1**
   This phrase in his Concept of Mind. It ought to be said that Descartes himself denied that on his account the soul was lodged in the body ‘like a pilot in a ship’, so there is a scholarly issue of whe...

2. **Philosophical Action 2**
   giving rise to a physical event. So we take that as a model for the arbitrary creation of a universe by an intelligent deity. While we think like this we forget Schopenhauer’s point (see Chapter 3): s...

3. **Philosophical Action 3**
   When we think about reasoning. We want our reasonings to be good. We want to follow reliable methods for sifting truth from falsehood, and forming beliefs about our world. But which are these reliable...

8. **Philosophical Action 8**
   S them—the arrival of photons at the eye, in the case of colour, for example. Descartes similarly had a poor view of the senses as vehicles of truth (remember the ball of wax in Chapter 1): For the pr...

9. **Philosophical Action 9**
   Is that one of the premises is untrue. The second is that the reasoning is invalid. Of course, an argument may be subject to both criticisms: its premises are untrue, and the reasoning from them is in...

10. **Philosophical Action 10**
   In the right way. For instance, if a predator is coming, it needs some information that stimulates flight. However, for this function, it does not matter what experience it gets. If the predator tread...
